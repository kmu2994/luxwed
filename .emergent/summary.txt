The previous AI engineer successfully bootstrapped an AI-Powered Wedding Services Platform from scratch. The initial focus was on establishing the core full-stack architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and integrating a powerful LLM for conversational AI. The engineer prioritized the most valuable feature—the AI wedding planner and vendor recommendation—by first integrating the Google Gemini API, which the user provided. After the initial setup and backend testing, the user explicitly requested enhancing the AI with real-time web search capabilities. The engineer then focused on implementing this, modifying both backend API logic to use a web search tool and updating the frontend to reflect search activity. The work concluded with the engineer about to test this newly integrated web search functionality.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create an AI/ML-powered digital platform to revolutionize wedding planning, targeting middle-class families in India (Mumbai & Pune initially) with budgets of ₹3-15 lakhs. The platform's vision is to democratize luxury wedding services by providing transparent, efficient, and personalized experiences, operating on a zero-commission model for vendors. Key features include an AI-Powered Vendor Recommendation Engine (collaborative/content-based filtering, budget/style matching, location, real-time availability, quality scores), ML-Driven Price Prediction (XGBoost/Random Forest, LSTM for demand forecasting, RL for negotiation), a Conversational AI Wedding Planner (NLP with BERT/GPT, Dialogflow/Rasa for budget, timeline, vendor shortlisting, query resolution, checklist automation), and Image Recognition for style matching. The application is a B2B2C marketplace, aiming for rapid MVP development and a quick aha moment by focusing on core AI features first.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : This is the core of the backend FastAPI application. It handles API routes, database interactions, and LLM integration.
    -   **Summary of why important:** It exposes the  endpoint for conversational AI, initializes the Gemini LLM chat instance, and manages the chat history in MongoDB. It now also integrates and uses a  to provide real-time information.
    -   **Summary of changes:** Initially set up to handle basic chat with Gemini. Later modified to import and utilize , add logic to conditionally perform web searches based on user queries, and enhance the  endpoint to incorporate web search results into AI responses. A new endpoint  was also added.
-   : Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Summary of why important:** Ensures all necessary libraries, including  for LLM and possibly , are installed.
    -   **Summary of changes:**  was added to support Gemini LLM, and presumably  was also added.
-   : Stores critical environment variables for the backend.
    -   **Summary of why important:** Contains  for database connection and  for authenticating with the Gemini LLM service.
    -   **Summary of changes:** The  provided by the user was added to this file.
-   : The main React component rendering the user interface.
    -   **Summary of why important:** It contains the chat interface, sends user messages to the backend, displays AI responses, and manages the UI state.
    -   **Summary of changes:** Heavily modified to create the chat UI, display messages, send API requests to the backend, and manage loading states. Recent changes include adding visual indicators (, ) to show the AI's processing and web search status to the user.
-   : Stylesheet for .
    -   **Summary of why important:** Defines the visual styling of the chat application using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Summary of changes:** Modified to style the chat bubbles, input area, and dynamic loading indicators for AI processing and web search.
-   : Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Summary of why important:** Contains  to correctly point API calls to the backend service.
    -   **Summary of changes:** No direct changes, but its existence is crucial for backend connectivity.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of the **AI-powered vendor recommendation system** (user preference collection, detailed matching algorithm).
-   Development of advanced **Conversational AI Wedding Planner capabilities** beyond basic chat (budget planning, timeline generation, vendor shortlisting).
-   Implementation of **ML-driven price prediction** models.
-   Development of the **User Management System** (authentication, profile management, KYC for vendors).
-   Building the **Vendor Management Platform** (onboarding, portfolio, availability, analytics).
-   Creating the **Booking & Payment Engine** (booking workflow, EMI, escrow, invoice automation).
-   Integrating **Stripe** for payments and **WhatsApp Business API** for communication.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has successfully set up the foundational full-stack application. This includes:
1.  **React Frontend:** A functional and aesthetically pleasing chat-based UI has been developed using React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to input messages and displays the AI's responses in a conversational format.
2.  **FastAPI Backend:** A FastAPI server () is running, serving as the API gateway. It handles incoming chat requests, processes them using an LLM, and stores chat history in MongoDB.
3.  **MongoDB Integration:** MongoDB is configured and used to persist chat messages, ensuring conversation history is maintained across sessions.
4.  **Gemini LLM Integration:** The core AI functionality is powered by Google Gemini, using the  library. The user provided a valid Gemini API key which has been configured in the backend's  file. Initial backend testing confirmed successful chat message sending and receiving.

Immediately before this summary request, the engineer was actively working on enhancing the AI agent with **web search capabilities**. This was a direct request from the user to allow the AI to fetch real-time online details.
-   The backend () was modified to:
    -   Import and utilize a .
    -   Implement logic within the chat endpoint to conditionally trigger web searches based on the user's query.
    -   Incorporate the results from the web search into the AI's response.
    -   A new  endpoint was also added, likely for direct search functionality.
-   The frontend (, , ) was updated to:
    -   Display dynamic loading indicators such as Thinking... and Searching the web... to provide real-time feedback to the user when the AI is processing or performing a web search.
-   The backend server was restarted to apply these changes.

The current state is that the web search integration has been implemented across both frontend and backend, and the next immediate step is to test this new functionality.
